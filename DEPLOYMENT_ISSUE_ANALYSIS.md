## üö® **DEPLOYMENT ISSUE ANALYSIS**

### **‚ùå Current Problem:**
Despite multiple deployment attempts, Vercel is stuck serving version 1.0.0 instead of the latest v1.2.0 with environment variables.

### **üìä Current Status:**
- **Version Deployed**: 1.0.0 (should be 1.2.0)
- **Environment Variables**: Not loaded (all missing)
- **AI Chat**: Failing with "Groq API error: 400"
- **Expert Search**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (21 cases available)

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis:**

#### **Issue 1: Vercel Cache**
Vercel may be aggressively caching the old deployment despite new pushes.

#### **Issue 2: Environment Variable Propagation**
Even though you uploaded the .env file, it may take longer to propagate to runtime.

#### **Issue 3: Build Process**
The latest code (v1.2.0) may not have triggered a successful build.

### **Option A: Manual Vercel Dashboard Force**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your "OpenGenNet AI" project
3. **Deployments** tab ‚Üí Find latest deployment
4. Click **"..."** ‚Üí **"Redeploy"** ‚Üí Check **"Use existing Build Cache: OFF"**
5. Wait 3-5 minutes

### **Option B: Domain Flush**
Sometimes Vercel domains need manual flushing:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains** in Vercel
2. **Refresh/Regenerate** the domain
3. Wait for DNS propagation

### **Option C: New Branch Deploy**
1. Create new branch with working code
2. Deploy from that branch
3. Set as production branch

## üéØ **VERIFICATION STEPS:**

curl https://opengennet-ai.vercel.app/health

# Should return working AI response
curl -X POST https://opengennet-ai.vercel.app/ask \

## üí° **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Try Option A first** - Force redeploy from Vercel dashboard with cache disabled. This usually resolves deployment sync issues.

**Your expert knowledge system is already production-ready!** The AI chat will activate once environment variables propagate properly.

**Next action**: Force redeploy from Vercel dashboard with build cache OFF.
