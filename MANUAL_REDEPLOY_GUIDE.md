üöÄ **MANUAL VERCEL REDEPLOY STEPS**

Your enhanced OpenGenNet AI with expert knowledge integration is ready! 
The status endpoint shows 21 expert cases are loaded and working.

## Issue: Root Route (/) Returns 404
- All other endpoints work perfectly (/health, /status, /ask, /search, /debug)
- Expert knowledge integration is complete and functional
- Only the root route `/` needs fixing

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - Manual Redeploy:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "opengennet-ai" project
3. Click on the project

### Step 2: Force Redeploy
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Find the latest deployment (should show "59af3f9" commit)
3. Click the 3 dots menu (‚ãØ) next to the deployment
4. Select **"Redeploy"**
5. Choose **"Redeploy without build cache"** ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT!
6. Click "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Wait & Test
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Test: https://opengennet-ai.vercel.app/
3. Should return JSON with version "1.0.2"

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Expert Knowledge: 21 cases loaded (networking, cybersecurity, cloud computing)
‚úÖ Enhanced AI: Context search and enriched prompts working
‚úÖ All endpoints: /health, /status, /ask, /search, /debug
‚ùå Root route: Returns 404 (needs manual redeploy)

## Alternative: If manual redeploy doesn't work:
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Reimport from GitHub (fresh deployment)
3. Set environment variables again

**The AI system is fully enhanced and ready - just need to fix the root route!**
