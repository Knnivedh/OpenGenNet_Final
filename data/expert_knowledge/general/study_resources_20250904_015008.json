      "title": "OSPF Routing Protocol Overview - Study CCNA",
      "content": "OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). It is a link-state routing protocol that uses the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate the best route. OSPF routing protocol is an open standard, so various network vendors implement it. Here are the most important features of OSPF: A classless routing protocol Supports VLSM, CIDR, manual route summarization, equal cost load balancing Incremental updates are supported Uses only one parameter as the metric – the interface cost. The administrative distance of OSPF routes is, by default, 110. Uses multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 for routing updates. Routers running OSPF protocol have to establish neighbor relationships before exchanging routes. Because OSPF is a link-state routing protocol, neighbors don’t exchange routing tables. Instead, they exchange information about network topology. Each OSPF router then runs SPF or Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the best routes and adds those to the routing table. Because each router knows the entire topology of a network, the chance for a routing loop to occur is minimal. Each OSPF router stores routing and topology information in three tables: Neighbor table – stores information about OSPF neighbors Topology table – stores the topology structure of a network Routing table – stores the best routes OSPF Neighbors OSPF routers need to establish a neighbor relationship before exchanging routing updates. OSPF neighbors are dynamically discovered by sending Hello packets from each OSPF-enabled interface on a router. Hello packets are sent to the multicast IP address of 224.0.0.5. The process is explained in the following figure: Routers R1 and R2 are directly connected. After OSPF is enabled, both routers send Hellos to establish a neighbor relationship. You can verify that the neighbor relationship has been established by typing the ‘show ip ospf neighbors’ command. R1#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 2.2.2.2 1 FULL/DR 00:00:30 192.168.0.2 FastEthernet0/0 In the example above, you can see that the router-id of R2 is 2.2.2.2. Each OSPF router is assigned a router ID. A router ID is determined by using one of the following: 1. Using the router-id command under the OSPF process. 2. Using the highest IP address of the router’s loopback interfaces. 3. Using the highest IP address of the router’s physical interfaces. The following fields in the Hello packets must be the same on both routers in order for routers to become neighbors: subnet area id hello and dead interval timers authentication area stub flag MTU By default, OSPF sends hello packets every 10 seconds on an Ethernet network (Hello interval). A dead timer is four times the value of the hello interval, so if a router on an Ethernet network doesn’t receive at least one Hello packet from an OSPF neighbor for 40 seconds, the router declares that neighbor to be down. OSPF Neighbor States Before establishing a neighbor relationship, OSPF routers need to go through several state changes. These states are explained below: 1. Init state – a router has received a Hello message from the other OSPF router 2. 2-way state – the neighbor has received the Hello message and replied with a Hello message of his own 3. Exstart state – beginning of the Link State Database (LSDB) exchange between both routers. Routers are starting to exchange link state information. 4. Exchange state – DBD (Database Descriptor) packets are exchanged. DBDs contain LSAs headers. Routers will use this information to see what LSAs need to be exchanged. 5. Loading state – one neighbor sends LSRs (Link State Requests) for every network it doesn’t know about. The other neighbor replies with the LSUs (Link State Updates), which contain information about requested networks. After all the requested information have been received, other neighbor goes through the same process 6. Full state – both routers have the synchronized database and are fully adjacent to each other. NOTE Depending on the network, OSPF can elect a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR). DR and BDR serve as the central point for exchanging OSPF routing information. OSPF Routing Protocol Areas OSPF uses the concept of areas. An area is a logical grouping of contiguous networks and routers. All routers in the same area have the same topology table, but they don’t know about routers in the other areas. The main benefits of creating areas are that the size of the topology and the routing table on a router is reduced, less time is required to run the SPF algorithm, and routing updates are also reduced. Each area in the OSPF network has to connect to the backbone area (area 0). All routers inside an area must have the same area ID to become OSPF neighbors. A router with interfaces in more than one area (area 0 and area 1, for example) is called Area Border Router (ABR). A router that connects an OSPF network to other routing domains (EIGRP network, for example) is called Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR). NOTE In OSPF, manual route summarization is possible only on ABRs and ASBRs. To better understand the concept of OSPF areas, consider the following example. All routers are running OSPF. Routers R1 and R2 are inside the backbone area (area 0). Router R3 is an ABR because it has interfaces in two areas, namely Area 0 and Area 1. Routers R4 and R5 are inside Area 1. Router R6 is an ASBR because it connects the OSPF network to another routing domain (an EIGRP domain in this case). If the R1’s directly connected subnet fails, router R1 sends the routing update only to R2 and R3 because all routing updates are localized inside the area. NOTE The role of an ABR is to advertise address summaries to neighboring areas. The role of an ASBR is to connect an OSPF routing domain to another external network (e.g. Internet, EIGRP network…). LSA, LSU, and LSR OSPF routers use the LSAs (Link-State Advertisements) to exchange topology information. Each LSA contains routing and topology information to describe a part of an OSPF network. When two neighbors decide to exchange routes, they send each other a list of all LSAs in their respective topology databases. Each router then checks its topology database and sends a Link State Request (LSR) message requesting all LSAs not found in its topology table. The other router responds with the Link State Update (LSU) containing all LSAs the other neighbor requested. The concept is explained in the following example: After configuring OSPF on both routers, routers exchange LSAs to describe their topology database. Router R1 sends an LSA header for its directly connected network 10.0.1.0/24. Router R2 checks its topology database and determines that it doesn’t have information about that network. Router R2 then sends a Link State Request message requesting further information about that network. Router R1 responds with Link State Update, which contains information about subnet 10.0.1.0/24, such as next hop address, cost, etc. Download our Free CCNA Study Guide PDF for complete notes on all the CCNA 200-301 exam topics in one book.

      "title": "EIGRP Routing Protocol Overview - Study CCNA",
      "content": "NOTE EIGRP is not explicitly listed in the latest 200-301 version of the CCNA exam topics (whereas OSPF is) but you can still be tested on it in the exam. EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is an advanced distance vector routing protocol. This protocol is an evolution of an earlier Cisco protocol called IGRP, which is now considered obsolete. EIGRP supports classless routing and VLSM, route summarization, incremental updates, load balacing and many other useful features. It is a Cisco propriatery protocol, so all routers in a network that is running EIGRP must be Cisco routers. Routers running EIGRP must become neighbors before exchanging routing information. To dynamically discover neighbors, EIGRP routers use the multicast address of 224.0.0.10. Each EIGRP router stores routing and topology information in three tables: Neighbor table – stores information about EIGRP neighbors Topology table – stores routing information learned from neighboring routers Routing table – stores the best routes Administrative distance of EIGRP is 90, which is less than both the administrative distance of RIP and the administrative distance of OSPF, so EIGRP routes will be preferred over these routes. EIGRP uses Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) for sending messages. EIGRP calculates its metric by using bandwidth, delay, reliability and load. By default, only bandwidth and delay are used when calulating metric, while reliability and load are set to zero. EIGPR uses the concept of autonomous systems. An autonomous system is a set of EIGRP enabled routers that should become EIGRP neighbors. Each router inside an autonomous system must have the same autonomous system number configured, otherwise routers will not become neighbors. EIGRP Neighbors EIGRP must establish neighbor relationships with other EIGRP neighboring routers before exchanging routing information. To establish a neighbor relationships, routers send hello packets every couple of seconds. Hello packets are sent to the multicast address of 224.0.0.10. NOTE On LAN interfaces hellos are sent every 5 seconds. On WAN interfaces every 60 seconds. The following fields in a hello packet must be the identical in order for routers to become neighbors: ASN (autonomous system number) subnet number K values (components of metric) Routers send hello packets every couple of seconds to ensure that the neighbor relationship is still active. By default, routers considers the neighbor to be down after a hold-down timer has expired. Hold-down timer is, by default, three times the hello interval. On LAN network the hold-down timer is 15 seconds. Feasible and reported distance Two terms that you will often encounter when working with EIGRP are feasible and reported distance. Let’s clarify these terms: Feasible distance (FD) – the metric of the best route to reach a network. That route will be listed in the routing table. Reported distance (RD) – the metric advertised by a neighboring router for a specific route. It other words, it is the metric of the route used by the neighboring router to reach the network. To better understand the concept, consider the following example. EIGRP has been configured on R1 and R2. R2 is directly connected to the subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and advertises that subnet into EIGRP. Let’s say that R2’s metric to reach that subnet is 28160. When the subnet is advertised to R1, R2 informs R1 that its metric to reach 10.0.1.0/24 is 28160. From the R1’s perspective that metric is considered to be the reported distance for that route. R1 receives the update and adds the metric to the neighbor to the reported distance. That metric is called the feasible distance and is stored in R1’s routing table (30720 in our case). The feasible and reported distance are displayed in R1’s EIGRP topology table: R1#show ip eigrp topology IP-EIGRP Topology Table for AS 1/ID(192.168.0.1) Codes: P - Passive, A - Active, U - Update, Q - Query, R - Reply, r - Reply status P 10.0.1.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 30720 via 192.168.0.2 (30720/28160), FastEthernet0/0 P 192.168.0.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 28160 via Connected, FastEthernet0/0 Successor and feasible successor Another two terms that appear often in the EIGRP world are successor and feasible successor. A successor is the route with the best metric to reach a destination. That route is stored in the routing table. A feasible successor is a backup path to reach that same destination that can be used immediately if the successor route fails. These backup routes are stored in the topology table. For a route to be chosen as a feasible successor, one condition must be met: the neighbor’s advertised distance (AD) for the route must be less than the successor’s feasible distance (FD). The following example explains the concept of a successor and a feasible successor. R1 has two paths to reach the subnet 10.0.0.0/24. The path through R2 has the best metric (20) and it is stored in the R1’s routing table. The other route, through R3, is a feasible successor route, because the feasiblility condition has been met (R3’s advertised distance of 15 is less than R1’s feasible distance of 20). R1 stores that route in the topology table. This route can be immediately used if the primary route fails. EIGRP topology table EIGRP toplogy table contains all learned routes to a destination. The table holds all routes received from a neighbor, successors and feasible successors for every route, and interfaces on which updates were received. The table also holds all locally connected subnets included in an EIGRP process. Best routes (the successors) from the topology table are stored in the routing table. Feasible successors are only stored in the topology table and can be used immediately if the primary route fails. Consider the following network topology. EIGRP is running on all three routers. Routers R2 and R3 both connect to the subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and advertise that subnet to R1. R1 receives both updates and calulates the best route. The best path goes through R2, so R1 stores that route in the routing table. Router R1 also calculates the metric of the route through R3. Let’s say that advertised distance of that route is less then feasible distance of the best route. The feasibility condition is met and router R1 stores that route in the topology table as a feasible successor route. The route can be used immediately if the primary route fails.
