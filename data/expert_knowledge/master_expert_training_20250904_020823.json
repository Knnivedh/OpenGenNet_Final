PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) manages digital certificates throughout their lifecycle. Certificate authorities (CAs) issue and revoke certificates. OCSP provides real-time certificate status. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures session key compromise doesn't affect past communications. Quantum-resistant algorithms prepare for post-quantum cryptography.\n\nTechnical Details: Configuration parameters should be tuned based on network size and traffic patterns.",
