      "content": "Table of Contents Toggle OSPFv2 Overview OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), is one of the most used Routing Protocol today. OSPF is a standard based Link-State routing protocol. It is a Classless routing protocol which do not send subnet masks with updates. So, it allows to use VLSM. Open Shortest Path First has similarities with the other Link-State routing protocol IS-IS but it differents from it in many points. Open Shortest Path First uses a special algorithm, Dijsktra Alogirthm for route calculations. In other words, it uses Shortest Path First (SPF) method and with this way, the routing calculation is done. In OSPF, both periodic and triggered updates are used. These updates are sent with LSA (Link State Advertisements). There are also different OSPF packets used for the messaging between OSPF routers. OSPF is ideal for large networks and the convergence time of OSPF is very short. In other words, OSPF is a fast converged protocol. It is also prefered because of its secure character. As a hierarchical protocol, Open Shortest Path Firt divided into different Areas. This areas reduce the complexity of the network and opitmize routing tables. You can view detailed OSPF lessons below: Key Lessons: OSPF Adjacency Area Types Packet Types LSA Types Network Types OSPF Cost and SPF Algorithm Virtual Links, Authentication, Timers Areas & Configurations: Single Area OSPF Configuration Standard & Backbone Area Config Stub Area & Totally Stub Area Config NSSA & Totally NSSA Configuration OSPF External Routes OSPFv3 OSPFv3 OSPFv3 Configuration OSPF Tables Open Shortest Path First provides neighbourship between other OSFP routers by the help of OSPF messages. With these messages, OSPF tables are built. And Open Shortest Path First routing mechanims works with this tables. Basically, there are three tables in Open Shrtest Path First. These tables are: Neighboring Table Topology Table Routing Table Neighboring Table, is the table that stotres OSPF neighbor routers. You can see the directly connected OSFP neighbors here. Topoloji Table, is the view of OSPF network. It is also known as LSDB. All the Open Shortest Path First Router connections are stored here. Topology table is identical in all OSPF routers in the Open Shortst ath Firstnetwork. Routing Table, is the tablet hat stores the best paths to the destination. It is the table that is also sued with the other routing prtocols for routing process. In Open Shortest Path First, all routers build its own Topology Table and has the full view of the network. It calculates the next hope independently from other routers. This is also the characteristic of Link-State Protocols. As you remember, Link-State protocols are “OSPF” and “IS-IS”. In Distance-Vector protocols, the situation is not like this. Distance-Vector protocols needs a neighbor to know about the network. Open Shortest Path Fist routers announces the netwrok changes with LSAs eachother. LSDBs are built with these LSAs. The topology of the Open Shortest Path First network is stored in this LSDB (Link State Database). Hierarchical Design and Area Types Open Shortest Path First has an hierarchical architecture. It uses “Areas” for hieararcy. There is a Backbone Area as Area 0 in the center for all OSPF Networks. Around this Backbone Area, Area 0, there are some other Areas. All these areas are connected to this Area 0. If there is a uncontinuous structure, Virtual-Links can be used to connect an area to the Backbone Area (Area 0). With this hierachical architecture of Open Shortest Path First, you can divide your network into different small areas and by doing this, you can reduce overhead of this small areas. In other words, instead of doing LSDB processes for one large area, this is done in smaller areas and update summary LSAs are sent to the other areas. By doing this, LSA traffic is reduced. Beside Backbone Area and Normal Areas, there are alsom other area types in Open Shortest Path First network. You can find these area types below: Standard Area Backbone Area (Area 0) Stub Area Not So Stubby Area (NSSA) Totally Stub Area Totally NSSA In CCNA 200-301, there is only Single Area OSPF. So, we will not explain the other areas here. If you would like to learn OSPF Area types detailly, you can check the related lessons on CCNP ENCOR and CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure courses. OSPF Router Types In OSPF Design there are different Router types. These router types are named according to their roles and their place of the network. Let’s see these routers: Internal Routers: Routers in a Single Area. Backbone Routers: Routers in Backbone Area (Area 0) (At least one interface). Area Border Routers (ABRs): Routers have interfaces at least in two areas. Autonomus System Boundary Routers (ASBRs): Routers connected to an another AS and the routers in which external routes are redistributed. OSPF Administrative Distance Values For Best Path selection, Administrative Distance (Preference) values are very important. Every Routing Protocol has an AD value. The Administrative Distance (Preference) of the Open Shortest Path First is 110 for Cisco devices. This is a little different for Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Juniper devices. They use Interneal and External Preference values for Open Shortest Path First. Preference value is 10 for Internal OSPF Routes and 150 for External OSPF Routes on the devices of these vendors. Router ID Router ID is an important term for Open Shortest Path First Operations. Every router has to have a unique Router ID in the Open Shortest Path First Topology. So, generally Router ID is manually configured on all OSPF Routers. If this is not done, the highest interface IP address is selected as Router ID. Open Shortest Path First Cost Open Shortest Path First uses path Cost as its metric. Generally Bandwidth value is used as path Cost. AS a formula, the Cost is calculated like below in OSPF: Cost = Reference BW(default 10 000 000) / BW OSPF Versions Protocols are developed and then they enhanced with new features. This new enhanced versions came with new versions. Open Shortest Path First also has different versions. There are two OSFP versions. These are: OSPFv2 OSPFv3 OSPFv2 is the first version of Open Shortest Path First and it is used with IPv4. OSPFv3 is the enhanced version of OSPFv2 that supports and designed for IPv6. In the below table, you can check the differences of these two versions as summary. In this article, we have talked about an overview of OSPFv2. In the following articles, we will explain this lesson more deeply. If you want to learn more about OSPFv3, you can check IPv6 Routing Protocols lesson. Become a Member!

      "title": "EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) ⋆ IpCisco",
      "content": "Table of Contents Toggle EIGRP Overview EIGRP Protocol is one of the most used Dynamic Routing Protocol as IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol). Especially it is used for Routing purpose inside the networks that is mostly consist of Cisco devices. EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Hybrid Routing Protocol that show both Distance Vector and Link-State Routing Protocol properties. It was developed by Cisco as an enhancement to IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) and as a Cisco proprietary protocol and it is only available on Cisco devices. You can test your Routing Knowledge on CCNP ENCOR Practice Tests and CCNP ENARSI Practice Page Page! EIGRP DUAL Algorithm EIGRP uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) for routing calculations. Periodic Updates are not used but if a change occurs in the network like up/down links, update messages are sent. With DUAL Algotirhm, Topology table is built. In Topology Table both the Best Routes and the Backup Routes to a destination are stored. This provides, a Fast Convergence characteristic, a Fast Convergence Mechanims. The most important characteristic of this routing protocol is that, it is a Fast Converged Routing Protocol. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol keeps the “Backup Routes” beside the “Best Route” to a destination in the Topology table. So, during a failure, it does not need to calculate a new route. Instead, it uses the Backup Route towards the destination. EIGRP Messages EIGRP uses different types of messages to build neighbourship, to keep the connection and for the updates. These main messages are : Hello Update Query Reply Ack Hello Packets are used to establish and maintain EIGRP Neighbourship. Update Packets are used to send routing updates. Query Packets are used to ask for any routing update, requests an update. Reply Packets are used as a response to the Query Packets. ACK Packets are used as a feedback to the Update, Query or Reply packets as a feedback mechanism. We will learn these EIGRP Packets detailly in next lessons. EIGRP Tables Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol has three tables. These tables are used on Routing Operation. The EIGRP Tables are given below: Neighbour Table Topology Table Routing Table Neighbor Table is the table that keeps All EIGRP Neighbour Routers. Topology Table is the table that keeps All Routes to all the destinations Routing Table is the table that keeps the Best Routes to any destinations. Classless Protocol Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol is a Classless Routing Protocol. It sends the subnet masks in the Update Packets. VLSM Support Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol also supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask). Different Subnet Masks can be used with this protocol. By using VLSM, it is a protocol that uses the IP addresses range very efficent. EIGRP Metrics Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses a very complex metric by using bandwith, delay, load, reliability and MTU values. This EIGRP Metric Formula is showed below: EIGRP Metric Formula As you can see, there are some K values in EGRP metric formule. By default these values are: K1 (Bandwidth) = 1 K2 (Load) = 0 K3 (Delay) = 1 K4(Reliability) = 0 K5(MTU) = 0 These K values need to be match in both ends to form an EIGRP Neighbourship. You can change these values but it is not recommended. By default Bandwith and Delay values become important only and used as a metric (The other parts will be 0, becaue of multiplying with 0). So, we can say that, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses the path with minimum bandwidth and the total delay to a destination. Bandwidth = 107/Bandwidth in Kbps Delay = Delay / 10 The default Formula becomes like below (with default K values ) : You can test your Routing Knowledge on CCNP ENCOR Practice Tests and CCNP ENARSI Practice Page Page! EIGRP Default Metric Protocol Indemendence Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol works with IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk Routed Protocols. So with this characteristic, we can say that EIGRP is a Protocol Independent Routing Protocol. EIGRP Administrative Distance The Administrative Distance (Preference) values for EIGRP are given below: Internal : 90 External : 170 Summary : 5 If there are routes to a destination with Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, RIP and OSPF, EIGRP (Internal) Routes are prefered over RIP and OSPF Routes. Because the administartive distance of RIP is 120 and OSPF Administrative Distance is 110. You can find Administrative Distance (Preference) Table for Cisco, Juniper, Nokia and Huawei, on IPCisco.com. RTP for Reliable Delivery Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol) to control sending and acknowledging messages. In other words, RTP ensures delivery of packets. RTP is used by Update, Query and Reply packets. Hello and Ack packets do not use RTP. Become a Member!

      "title": "Spanning Tree Protocol | STP Overview | STP Types ⋆ IPCisco",
      "content": "Table of Contents Toggle STP Overview In Layer 2 domain, redundancy is an important case. To provide redundant links, multiple connections are done between switches. But this redundancy mechanism can cause an undesirable situation that is called “L2 Loop”. To provide L2 redundancy and to avoid L2 loops, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) has been developed. In this lesson we will focus STP Overview. In another lesson we will focus STP Configuration. You can also view Spanning Tree Protocol details lesson. During the development period, various versions of STP has been introduced. Different standards has been created beside Cisco specific versions. These STP versions are : STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) – 802.1D RSTP(Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) – 802.1W PVST+(Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus) – Cisco Proprietary Rapid PVST+(Rapid Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus) – Cisco Proprietary MST(Multiple Spanning Tree) – 802.1s You can also view Cisco Packet Tracer Spanning Tree Spanning Tree Examples: STP Configuration RSTP Configuration STP Portfast Configuration PVST+ Configuration In this article, mainly we will focus on STP (802.1D). Redundant Layer 2 Problems Redundancy is an important term for a network. Layer 2 Redundancy is also important but need more caution. Without a mechanims like STP, Layer 2 Redundancy mechanisms can cause the below problems: Layer 2 Loops and Broadcast Storms MAC Address Instability Duplicate Frame Transmission Let’s talk about each of these Layer 2 Redundacy problems. Layer 2 Loops and Broadcast Storms Layer 2 Loops can occur when there is a multiple available Layer 2 link and this links also send and receive frames more than one. And because of the fact that, there is no TTL mechanims in Layer 2, Layer 2 Loops occurs. As you remember, in Layer 3, there is a TTL mechanism. Think about the below topology: Here, when Switch A receives a frame from Segment 1 and send it to the Segment 2, Switch B also can learn it from Segment 2. And it also sends this frame to Segment 1 as if it is being done first time. So, frames are doubled and a Layer 2 Loop Occured. And this Layer 2 loop causes a Broadcast Storm. An infinite frame send/receive process occurs. One loop in a Layer 2 domain can cause one more Alyer 2 loops even if the siwtched network is a large network. MAC Address Instability This Loops also cause a MAC Instability issue. As you remember, source address of a frame is important for MAC address types. These tables are created with source ports and MAC addresses. During a Loop, a frame can be received from different sources. So MAC Instability problem occurs. Here, a MAC table can have multiple MAC addresses for the same ports. This is an undefinable case for switches. Multiple Frame Transmission Multiple Frame Transmission is the problem of multiple, unnecessariliy transfer of Layer 2 frames. Because of there are multiple paths to a destination, same frame can be sent through different ways and this causes multiple frame transmission. How STP Avoid Layer 2 Loops? Now you can think that, we will both want to have redundant links and we want to avoid from Layer 2 Loops. How can we achieve this? We will achieve this with the Spanning Tree Protocol(STP). Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) has a mechanims to avoid Layer 2 Loops. With its mechanism, it checked all the available links. It determiens primary and backups of redundant links. According to some algorithms, some of the links pruned and only one available link become active at the same time to a destination. We can say that Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) mechanims basically prunes the unnecessary links at that time. If this link become offline because of a problem, then STP make another link as active. And the communication continue with another available way. At a time, only one link is active with STP. BPDU BPDU is the abbreviation of Bridge Protocol Data Unit. BPDU is the messages used between switches. BPDUs are sent and received from the ports. But blocking ports are only receive them to determine any failure etc. They do not sent BPDUs. Become a Member!

      "content": "Table of Contents Toggle What is a VLAN? In this lesson, we will talk about one of the key lessons in networking, especially in switching. We will explain VLAN definition and we will answer the question what is a VLAN? In the following lessons, we will learn the details of Virtual LANs and we will practice with VLAN Configuration Examples . You can also check the definion on Wiki. VLAN Definition If we do a simple VLAN definition, Virtual Local Area Networks are the Logical Virtual Networks that groups network devices in it. In another definition, they are a layer 2 technology with which you can seperate big networks into smaller networks. This can be done for reducing broadcast traffic, network performance improvement, security purpose or to seperate different departments each other and for network flexibility. Basically VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) In a company, different Virtual LANs can be used for different departments. Think about that these departments are IT, HR and Finance. In a single company LAN, with Virtual LANs, each of these department networks become separate networks. Virtual LANs are Logical networks. In the first place they are defined on the switches and then the ports are assigned to them. By doing this, VLANs members ports appear. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)We will learn the key points of Virtual LANs, but firstly, let’s check two important domain  Network Traffic Types Policing and Shaping in QoS Classification and Marking in QoS Quality of Service Overview AAA Radius Configuration for Wireless Users Cisco RADIUS Server Configuration on Packet Tracer TACACS+ Overview RADIUS Overview AAA Protocols : RADIUS and TACACS+ Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) Wireless WLAN Frequency Bands SSID Meaning Other Wireless Network Extention Types Wireless Principles WLAN Components Wireless Network Design Models WLC Management Access Connections Wireless Access Point Modes Wireless Security Protocols WLAN Configuration on Packet Tracer Security Fundamentals DHCP Snooping Configuration on Packet Tracer Cisco Banner Configuration on Packet Tracer What is DHCP Snooping?
