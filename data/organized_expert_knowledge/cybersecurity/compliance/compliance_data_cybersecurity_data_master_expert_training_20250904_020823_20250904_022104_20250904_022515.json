      "content": "Modern cryptography relies on mathematical complexity: symmetric algorithms (AES, ChaCha20), asymmetric algorithms (RSA, ECC), hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-3). PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) manages digital certificates throughout their lifecycle. Certificate authorities (CAs) issue and revoke certificates. OCSP provides real-time certificate status. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures session key compromise doesn't affect past communications. Quantum-resistant algorithms prepare for post-quantum cryptography.\n\nCompliance Requirement: Ensure this meets regulatory standards for your industry.",
