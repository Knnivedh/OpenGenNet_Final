      "content": "In large enterprise networks, BGP route optimization becomes critical for performance. Key strategies include route filtering with prefix-lists, AS-path prepending for traffic engineering, and communities for granular policy control. Real-world implementation requires careful planning of route-maps and understanding of BGP decision process.\n\nExpert Insight: Use BGP communities extensively for policy granularity.\n\nCase Study: Fortune 500 company reduced convergence time by 40% using optimized BGP communities.",
