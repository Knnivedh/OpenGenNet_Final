Open Shortest Path First has similarities with the other Link-State routing protocol IS-IS but it differents from it in many points. Open Shortest Path First uses a special algorithm, Dijsktra Alogirthm for route calculations. In other words, it uses Shortest Path First (SPF) method and with this way, the routing calculation is done. In OSPF, both periodic and triggered updates are used. These updates are sent with LSA (Link State Advertisements). There are also different OSPF packets used for the messaging between OSPF routers. OSPF is ideal for large networks and the convergence time of OSPF is very short. In other words, OSPF is a fast converged protocol. It is also prefered because of its secure character. As a hierarchical protocol, Open Shortest Path Firt divided into different Areas. This areas reduce the complexity of the network and opitmize routing tables. You can view detailed OSPF lessons below: Key Lessons: OSPF Adjacency Area Types Packet Types LSA Types Network Types OSPF Cost and SPF Algorithm Virtual Links, Authentication, Timers Areas & Configurations: Single Area OSPF Configuration Standard & Backbone Area Config Stub Area & Totally Stub Area Config NSSA & Totally NSSA Configuration OSPF External Routes OSPFv3 OSPFv3 OSPFv3 Configuration OSPF Tables Open Shortest Path First provides neighbourship between other OSFP routers by the help of OSPF messages. With these messages, OSPF tables are built. And Open Shortest Path First routing mechanims works with this tables. Basically, there are three tables in Open Shrtest Path First. These tables are: Neighboring Table Topology Table Routing Table Neighboring Table, is the table that stotres OSPF neighbor routers. You can see the directly connected OSFP neighbors here. Topoloji Table, is the view of OSPF network. It is also known as LSDB. All the Open Shortest Path First Router connections are stored here. Topology table is identical in all OSPF routers in the Open Shortst ath Firstnetwork. Routing Table, is the tablet hat stores the best paths to the destination. It is the table that is also sued with the other routing prtocols for routing process. In Open Shortest Path First, all routers build its own Topology Table and has the full view of the network. It calculates the next hope independently from other routers. This is also the characteristic of Link-State Protocols. As you remember, Link-State protocols are “OSPF” and “IS-IS”. In Distance-Vector protocols, the situation is not like this. Distance-Vector protocols needs a neighbor to know about the network. Open Shortest Path Fist routers announces the netwrok changes with LSAs eachother. LSDBs are built with these LSAs. The topology of the Open Shortest Path First network is stored in this LSDB (Link State Database). Hierarchical Design and Area Types Open Shortest Path First has an hierarchical architecture. It uses “Areas” for hieararcy. There is a Backbone Area as Area 0 in the center for all OSPF Networks. Around this Backbone Area, Area 0, there are some other Areas. All these areas are connected to this Area 0. If there is a uncontinuous structure, Virtual-Links can be used to connect an area to the Backbone Area (Area 0). With this hierachical architecture of Open Shortest Path First, you can divide your network into different small areas and by doing this, you can reduce overhead of this small areas. In other words, instead of doing LSDB processes for one large area, this is done in smaller areas and update summary LSAs are sent to the other areas. By doing this, LSA traffic is reduced. Beside Backbone Area and Normal Areas, there are alsom other area types in Open Shortest Path First network. You can find these area types below: Standard Area Backbone Area (Area 0) Stub Area Not So Stubby Area (NSSA) Totally Stub Area Totally NSSA In CCNA 200-301, there is only Single Area OSPF. So, we will not explain the other areas here. If you would like to learn OSPF Area types detailly, you can check the related lessons on CCNP ENCOR and CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure courses. OSPF Router Types In OSPF Design there are different Router types. These router types are named according to their roles and their place of the network. Let’s see these routers: Internal Routers: Routers in a Single Area. Backbone Routers: Routers in Backbone Area (Area 0) (At least one interface). Area Border Routers (ABRs): Routers have interfaces at least in two areas. Autonomus System Boundary Routers (ASBRs): Routers connected to an another AS and the routers in which external routes are redistributed. OSPF Administrative Distance Values For Best Path selection, Administrative Distance (Preference) values are very important. Every Routing Protocol has an AD value. The Administrative Distance (Preference) of the Open Shortest Path First is 110 for Cisco devices. This is a little different for Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and Juniper devices. They use Interneal and External Preference values for Open Shortest Path First. Preference value is 10 for Internal OSPF Routes and 150 for External OSPF Routes on the devices of these vendors. Router ID Router ID is an important term for Open Shortest Path First Operations. Every router has to have a unique Router ID in the Open Shortest Path First Topology. So, generally Router ID is manually configured on all OSPF Routers. If this is not done, the highest interface IP address is selected as Router ID. Open Shortest Path First Cost Open Shortest Path First uses path Cost as its metric. Generally Bandwidth value is used as path Cost. AS a formula, the Cost is calculated like below in OSPF: Cost = Reference BW(default 10 000 000) / BW OSPF Versions Protocols are developed and then they enhanced with new features. This new enhanced versions came with new versions. Open Shortest Path First also has different versions. There are two OSFP versions. These are: OSPFv2 OSPFv3 OSPFv2 is the first version of Open Shortest Path First and it is used with IPv4. OSPFv3 is the enhanced version of OSPFv2 that supports and designed for IPv6. In the below table, you can check the differences of these two versions as summary. In this article, we have talked about an overview of OSPFv2. In the following articles, we will explain this lesson more deeply. If you want to learn more about OSPFv3, you can check IPv6 Routing Protocols lesson. Become a Member!

It was developed by Cisco as an enhancement to IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) and as a Cisco proprietary protocol and it is only available on Cisco devices. You can test your Routing Knowledge on CCNP ENCOR Practice Tests and CCNP ENARSI Practice Page Page! EIGRP DUAL Algorithm EIGRP uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) for routing calculations. Periodic Updates are not used but if a change occurs in the network like up/down links, update messages are sent. With DUAL Algotirhm, Topology table is built. In Topology Table both the Best Routes and the Backup Routes to a destination are stored. This provides, a Fast Convergence characteristic, a Fast Convergence Mechanims. The most important characteristic of this routing protocol is that, it is a Fast Converged Routing Protocol. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol keeps the “Backup Routes” beside the “Best Route” to a destination in the Topology table. So, during a failure, it does not need to calculate a new route. Instead, it uses the Backup Route towards the destination. EIGRP Messages EIGRP uses different types of messages to build neighbourship, to keep the connection and for the updates. These main messages are : Hello Update Query Reply Ack Hello Packets are used to establish and maintain EIGRP Neighbourship. Update Packets are used to send routing updates. Query Packets are used to ask for any routing update, requests an update. Reply Packets are used as a response to the Query Packets. ACK Packets are used as a feedback to the Update, Query or Reply packets as a feedback mechanism. We will learn these EIGRP Packets detailly in next lessons. EIGRP Tables Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol has three tables. These tables are used on Routing Operation. The EIGRP Tables are given below: Neighbour Table Topology Table Routing Table Neighbor Table is the table that keeps All EIGRP Neighbour Routers. Topology Table is the table that keeps All Routes to all the destinations Routing Table is the table that keeps the Best Routes to any destinations. Classless Protocol Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol is a Classless Routing Protocol. It sends the subnet masks in the Update Packets. VLSM Support Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol also supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask). Different Subnet Masks can be used with this protocol. By using VLSM, it is a protocol that uses the IP addresses range very efficent. EIGRP Metrics Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses a very complex metric by using bandwith, delay, load, reliability and MTU values. This EIGRP Metric Formula is showed below: EIGRP Metric Formula As you can see, there are some K values in EGRP metric formule. By default these values are: K1 (Bandwidth) = 1 K2 (Load) = 0 K3 (Delay) = 1 K4(Reliability) = 0 K5(MTU) = 0 These K values need to be match in both ends to form an EIGRP Neighbourship. You can change these values but it is not recommended. By default Bandwith and Delay values become important only and used as a metric (The other parts will be 0, becaue of multiplying with 0). So, we can say that, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses the path with minimum bandwidth and the total delay to a destination. Bandwidth = 107/Bandwidth in Kbps Delay = Delay / 10 The default Formula becomes like below (with default K values ) : You can test your Routing Knowledge on CCNP ENCOR Practice Tests and CCNP ENARSI Practice Page Page! EIGRP Default Metric Protocol Indemendence Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol works with IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk Routed Protocols. So with this characteristic, we can say that EIGRP is a Protocol Independent Routing Protocol. EIGRP Administrative Distance The Administrative Distance (Preference) values for EIGRP are given below: Internal : 90 External : 170 Summary : 5 If there are routes to a destination with Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, RIP and OSPF, EIGRP (Internal) Routes are prefered over RIP and OSPF Routes. Because the administartive distance of RIP is 120 and OSPF Administrative Distance is 110. You can find Administrative Distance (Preference) Table for Cisco, Juniper, Nokia and Huawei, on IPCisco.com. RTP for Reliable Delivery Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol uses RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol) to control sending and acknowledging messages. In other words, RTP ensures delivery of packets. RTP is used by Update, Query and Reply packets. Hello and Ack packets do not use RTP. Become a Member!

The administrative distance of OSPF routes is, by default, 110. Uses multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 for routing updates. Routers running OSPF protocol have to establish neighbor relationships before exchanging routes. Because OSPF is a link-state routing protocol, neighbors don’t exchange routing tables. Instead, they exchange information about network topology. Each OSPF router then runs SPF or Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the best routes and adds those to the routing table. Because each router knows the entire topology of a network, the chance for a routing loop to occur is minimal. Each OSPF router stores routing and topology information in three tables: Neighbor table – stores information about OSPF neighbors Topology table – stores the topology structure of a network Routing table – stores the best routes OSPF Neighbors OSPF routers need to establish a neighbor relationship before exchanging routing updates. OSPF neighbors are dynamically discovered by sending Hello packets from each OSPF-enabled interface on a router. Hello packets are sent to the multicast IP address of 224.0.0.5. The process is explained in the following figure: Routers R1 and R2 are directly connected. After OSPF is enabled, both routers send Hellos to establish a neighbor relationship. You can verify that the neighbor relationship has been established by typing the ‘show ip ospf neighbors’ command. R1#show ip ospf neighbor Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface 2.2.2.2 1 FULL/DR 00:00:30 192.168.0.2 FastEthernet0/0 In the example above, you can see that the router-id of R2 is 2.2.2.2. Each OSPF router is assigned a router ID. A router ID is determined by using one of the following: 1. Using the router-id command under the OSPF process. 2. Using the highest IP address of the router’s loopback interfaces. 3. Using the highest IP address of the router’s physical interfaces. The following fields in the Hello packets must be the same on both routers in order for routers to become neighbors: subnet area id hello and dead interval timers authentication area stub flag MTU By default, OSPF sends hello packets every 10 seconds on an Ethernet network (Hello interval). A dead timer is four times the value of the hello interval, so if a router on an Ethernet network doesn’t receive at least one Hello packet from an OSPF neighbor for 40 seconds, the router declares that neighbor to be down. OSPF Neighbor States Before establishing a neighbor relationship, OSPF routers need to go through several state changes. These states are explained below: 1. Init state – a router has received a Hello message from the other OSPF router 2. 2-way state – the neighbor has received the Hello message and replied with a Hello message of his own 3. Exstart state – beginning of the Link State Database (LSDB) exchange between both routers. Routers are starting to exchange link state information. 4. Exchange state – DBD (Database Descriptor) packets are exchanged. DBDs contain LSAs headers. Routers will use this information to see what LSAs need to be exchanged. 5. Loading state – one neighbor sends LSRs (Link State Requests) for every network it doesn’t know about. The other neighbor replies with the LSUs (Link State Updates), which contain information about requested networks. After all the requested information have been received, other neighbor goes through the same process 6. Full state – both routers have the synchronized database and are fully adjacent to each other. NOTE Depending on the network, OSPF can elect a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR). DR and BDR serve as the central point for exchanging OSPF routing information. OSPF Routing Protocol Areas OSPF uses the concept of areas. An area is a logical grouping of contiguous networks and routers. All routers in the same area have the same topology table, but they don’t know about routers in the other areas. The main benefits of creating areas are that the size of the topology and the routing table on a router is reduced, less time is required to run the SPF algorithm, and routing updates are also reduced. Each area in the OSPF network has to connect to the backbone area (area 0). All routers inside an area must have the same area ID to become OSPF neighbors. A router with interfaces in more than one area (area 0 and area 1, for example) is called Area Border Router (ABR). A router that connects an OSPF network to other routing domains (EIGRP network, for example) is called Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR). NOTE In OSPF, manual route summarization is possible only on ABRs and ASBRs. To better understand the concept of OSPF areas, consider the following example. All routers are running OSPF. Routers R1 and R2 are inside the backbone area (area 0). Router R3 is an ABR because it has interfaces in two areas, namely Area 0 and Area 1. Routers R4 and R5 are inside Area 1. Router R6 is an ASBR because it connects the OSPF network to another routing domain (an EIGRP domain in this case). If the R1’s directly connected subnet fails, router R1 sends the routing update only to R2 and R3 because all routing updates are localized inside the area. NOTE The role of an ABR is to advertise address summaries to neighboring areas. The role of an ASBR is to connect an OSPF routing domain to another external network (e.g. Internet, EIGRP network…). LSA, LSU, and LSR OSPF routers use the LSAs (Link-State Advertisements) to exchange topology information. Each LSA contains routing and topology information to describe a part of an OSPF network. When two neighbors decide to exchange routes, they send each other a list of all LSAs in their respective topology databases. Each router then checks its topology database and sends a Link State Request (LSR) message requesting all LSAs not found in its topology table. The other router responds with the Link State Update (LSU) containing all LSAs the other neighbor requested. The concept is explained in the following example: After configuring OSPF on both routers, routers exchange LSAs to describe their topology database. Router R1 sends an LSA header for its directly connected network 10.0.1.0/24. Router R2 checks its topology database and determines that it doesn’t have information about that network. Router R2 then sends a Link State Request message requesting further information about that network. Router R1 responds with Link State Update, which contains information about subnet 10.0.1.0/24, such as next hop address, cost, etc. Download our Free CCNA Study Guide PDF for complete notes on all the CCNA 200-301 exam topics in one book.

This protocol is an evolution of an earlier Cisco protocol called IGRP, which is now considered obsolete. EIGRP supports classless routing and VLSM, route summarization, incremental updates, load balacing and many other useful features. It is a Cisco propriatery protocol, so all routers in a network that is running EIGRP must be Cisco routers. Routers running EIGRP must become neighbors before exchanging routing information. To dynamically discover neighbors, EIGRP routers use the multicast address of 224.0.0.10. Each EIGRP router stores routing and topology information in three tables: Neighbor table – stores information about EIGRP neighbors Topology table – stores routing information learned from neighboring routers Routing table – stores the best routes Administrative distance of EIGRP is 90, which is less than both the administrative distance of RIP and the administrative distance of OSPF, so EIGRP routes will be preferred over these routes. EIGRP uses Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) for sending messages. EIGRP calculates its metric by using bandwidth, delay, reliability and load. By default, only bandwidth and delay are used when calulating metric, while reliability and load are set to zero. EIGPR uses the concept of autonomous systems. An autonomous system is a set of EIGRP enabled routers that should become EIGRP neighbors. Each router inside an autonomous system must have the same autonomous system number configured, otherwise routers will not become neighbors. EIGRP Neighbors EIGRP must establish neighbor relationships with other EIGRP neighboring routers before exchanging routing information. To establish a neighbor relationships, routers send hello packets every couple of seconds. Hello packets are sent to the multicast address of 224.0.0.10. NOTE On LAN interfaces hellos are sent every 5 seconds. On WAN interfaces every 60 seconds. The following fields in a hello packet must be the identical in order for routers to become neighbors: ASN (autonomous system number) subnet number K values (components of metric) Routers send hello packets every couple of seconds to ensure that the neighbor relationship is still active. By default, routers considers the neighbor to be down after a hold-down timer has expired. Hold-down timer is, by default, three times the hello interval. On LAN network the hold-down timer is 15 seconds. Feasible and reported distance Two terms that you will often encounter when working with EIGRP are feasible and reported distance. Let’s clarify these terms: Feasible distance (FD) – the metric of the best route to reach a network. That route will be listed in the routing table. Reported distance (RD) – the metric advertised by a neighboring router for a specific route. It other words, it is the metric of the route used by the neighboring router to reach the network. To better understand the concept, consider the following example. EIGRP has been configured on R1 and R2. R2 is directly connected to the subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and advertises that subnet into EIGRP. Let’s say that R2’s metric to reach that subnet is 28160. When the subnet is advertised to R1, R2 informs R1 that its metric to reach 10.0.1.0/24 is 28160. From the R1’s perspective that metric is considered to be the reported distance for that route. R1 receives the update and adds the metric to the neighbor to the reported distance. That metric is called the feasible distance and is stored in R1’s routing table (30720 in our case). The feasible and reported distance are displayed in R1’s EIGRP topology table: R1#show ip eigrp topology IP-EIGRP Topology Table for AS 1/ID(192.168.0.1) Codes: P - Passive, A - Active, U - Update, Q - Query, R - Reply, r - Reply status P 10.0.1.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 30720 via 192.168.0.2 (30720/28160), FastEthernet0/0 P 192.168.0.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 28160 via Connected, FastEthernet0/0 Successor and feasible successor Another two terms that appear often in the EIGRP world are successor and feasible successor. A successor is the route with the best metric to reach a destination. That route is stored in the routing table. A feasible successor is a backup path to reach that same destination that can be used immediately if the successor route fails. These backup routes are stored in the topology table. For a route to be chosen as a feasible successor, one condition must be met: the neighbor’s advertised distance (AD) for the route must be less than the successor’s feasible distance (FD). The following example explains the concept of a successor and a feasible successor. R1 has two paths to reach the subnet 10.0.0.0/24. The path through R2 has the best metric (20) and it is stored in the R1’s routing table. The other route, through R3, is a feasible successor route, because the feasiblility condition has been met (R3’s advertised distance of 15 is less than R1’s feasible distance of 20). R1 stores that route in the topology table. This route can be immediately used if the primary route fails. EIGRP topology table EIGRP toplogy table contains all learned routes to a destination. The table holds all routes received from a neighbor, successors and feasible successors for every route, and interfaces on which updates were received. The table also holds all locally connected subnets included in an EIGRP process. Best routes (the successors) from the topology table are stored in the routing table. Feasible successors are only stored in the topology table and can be used immediately if the primary route fails. Consider the following network topology. EIGRP is running on all three routers. Routers R2 and R3 both connect to the subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and advertise that subnet to R1. R1 receives both updates and calulates the best route. The best path goes through R2, so R1 stores that route in the routing table. Router R1 also calculates the metric of the route through R3. Let’s say that advertised distance of that route is less then feasible distance of the best route. The feasibility condition is met and router R1 stores that route in the topology table as a feasible successor route. The route can be used immediately if the primary route fails.
