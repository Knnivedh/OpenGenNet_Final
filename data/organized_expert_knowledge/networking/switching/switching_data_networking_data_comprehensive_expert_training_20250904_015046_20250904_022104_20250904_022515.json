Redundant Layer 2 Problems Redundancy is an important term for a network. Layer 2 Redundancy is also important but need more caution. Without a mechanims like STP, Layer 2 Redundancy mechanisms can cause the below problems: Layer 2 Loops and Broadcast Storms MAC Address Instability Duplicate Frame Transmission Let’s talk about each of these Layer 2 Redundacy problems. Layer 2 Loops and Broadcast Storms Layer 2 Loops can occur when there is a multiple available Layer 2 link and this links also send and receive frames more than one. And because of the fact that, there is no TTL mechanims in Layer 2, Layer 2 Loops occurs. As you remember, in Layer 3, there is a TTL mechanism. Think about the below topology: Here, when Switch A receives a frame from Segment 1 and send it to the Segment 2, Switch B also can learn it from Segment 2. And it also sends this frame to Segment 1 as if it is being done first time. So, frames are doubled and a Layer 2 Loop Occured. And this Layer 2 loop causes a Broadcast Storm. An infinite frame send/receive process occurs. One loop in a Layer 2 domain can cause one more Alyer 2 loops even if the siwtched network is a large network. MAC Address Instability This Loops also cause a MAC Instability issue. As you remember, source address of a frame is important for MAC address types. These tables are created with source ports and MAC addresses. During a Loop, a frame can be received from different sources. So MAC Instability problem occurs. Here, a MAC table can have multiple MAC addresses for the same ports. This is an undefinable case for switches. Multiple Frame Transmission Multiple Frame Transmission is the problem of multiple, unnecessariliy transfer of Layer 2 frames. Because of there are multiple paths to a destination, same frame can be sent through different ways and this causes multiple frame transmission. How STP Avoid Layer 2 Loops? Now you can think that, we will both want to have redundant links and we want to avoid from Layer 2 Loops. How can we achieve this? We will achieve this with the Spanning Tree Protocol(STP). Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) has a mechanims to avoid Layer 2 Loops. With its mechanism, it checked all the available links. It determiens primary and backups of redundant links. According to some algorithms, some of the links pruned and only one available link become active at the same time to a destination. We can say that Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) mechanims basically prunes the unnecessary links at that time. If this link become offline because of a problem, then STP make another link as active. And the communication continue with another available way. At a time, only one link is active with STP. BPDU BPDU is the abbreviation of Bridge Protocol Data Unit. BPDU is the messages used between switches. BPDUs are sent and received from the ports. But blocking ports are only receive them to determine any failure etc. They do not sent BPDUs. Become a Member!

In another definition, they are a layer 2 technology with which you can seperate big networks into smaller networks. This can be done for reducing broadcast traffic, network performance improvement, security purpose or to seperate different departments each other and for network flexibility. Basically VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) In a company, different Virtual LANs can be used for different departments. Think about that these departments are IT, HR and Finance. In a single company LAN, with Virtual LANs, each of these department networks become separate networks. Virtual LANs are Logical networks. In the first place they are defined on the switches and then the ports are assigned to them. By doing this, VLANs members ports appear.
